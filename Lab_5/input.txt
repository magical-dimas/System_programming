The Devourer of Gods is a post-Moon Lord boss that is intended to be fought after all of the Rune of Kos bosses have been defeated.
The fight against this boss is lengthy and difficult, with several phases and numerous varying attacks and behaviors.
Defeating him will provide the player with Cosmilite Bars, a crafting material necessary for crafting a variety of late-game equipment.
The Pumpkin Moon, Frost Moon, and Solar Eclipse events will significantly increase in difficulty as well, allowing enemies to drop Nightmare Fuel, Endothermic Energy, and Darksun Fragments respectively, which are also essential late-game crafting materials.
